# CAD in ExternalSoul: parts in, design around them, parts out

A CAD app on a workspace (`plugin_cad`, usually named by the person — find it with `list_workspaces` /
`get_app_tools(<app id>)`; its tools are minted `cad_<verb>_<Name>`; none yet → `create_app`
with `application_type: "plugin_cad"` and the model's name, in the workspace the parts belong to)
holds a MODEL as a timeline of STEPS: parametric programs (sketch → extrude/revolve → boolean/fillet/transform/style), imports of
workspace CAD files, and a person's by-hand edits. Every step is an event; the server replays them
in a headless kernel on `cad_build`, so nothing needs a tab. A by-hand edit (a move, a feature's
depth, a rename in the chili UI) is recorded as a DELTA of what the gesture changed, kept by the
platform's log even with no network and merged per part when two devices edit at once
(`cad_read_model` shows it as `changed: node:<id>.<property>`; a clash between two devices is
reported as "edit(s) landed in two places" — the person decides in the app, never overwrite it with
a program step on the same part without asking). Read `cad_help_<Name>` once per
session for the op shapes — this skill is about the WORKFLOW a CAD specialist expects.

## 1. Bring the person's parts into the workspace (Onshape, through their cloud browser)

Onshape has no anonymous export. The person logs into Onshape in their `cloud_browser` app (ask
them to; `browser_status_<Browser>` shows the login). Then everything is the browser's own session:

1. Parse the document link: `https://cad.onshape.com/documents/<did>/w/<wid>/e/<eid>` — `did`
   document, `wid` workspace, `eid` the open element (a part studio OR an assembly).
2. Find the parts with `browser_run_script_<Browser>` (same-origin fetch, the session's cookies):
   ```js
   const get = async (u) => { const r = await fetch(u, { credentials: 'include', headers: { Accept: 'application/json' } }); return r.ok ? r.json() : { status: r.status }; };
   const asm = await get(`/api/v6/assemblies/d/${did}/w/${wid}/e/${eid}?includeMateFeatures=true`);
   // asm.rootAssembly.instances → { name, elementId (the part studio), partId, transform (16 numbers, row-major 4×4, metres), hidden }
   // asm.rootAssembly.features → the mates. Or for a part studio: get(`/api/v6/parts/d/${did}/w/${wid}/e/${studioId}`)
   return asm;
   ```
   A hidden instance is still a part of the design — export it too.
3. Export each part studio as STEP (one translation per studio; poll until `DONE`):
   ```js
   const xsrf = decodeURIComponent((document.cookie.match(/(?:^|; )XSRF-TOKEN=([^;]+)/) || [])[1] || '');
   const hdr = { Accept: 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-XSRF-TOKEN': xsrf };
   const r = await fetch(`/api/v6/partstudios/d/${did}/w/${wid}/e/${studioId}/translations`, { method: 'POST', credentials: 'include', headers: hdr,
     body: JSON.stringify({ formatName: 'STEP', storeInDocument: false, stepVersionString: 'AP242', allowFaultyParts: true }) });
   const { id } = await r.json();
   // poll: GET /api/v6/translations/${id} → { requestState: 'DONE', resultExternalDataIds: [dataId] }
   ```
   The `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header is what makes the POST pass; without it Onshape answers 403.
4. Save the file into the workspace with `browser_download_<Browser>`:
   `{ url: "https://cad.onshape.com/api/v6/documents/d/<did>/externaldata/<dataId>", saveAs: "<part>.step", folderPath: "<project>" }`
   — the in-page fetch carries the login. The answer's `fileId` is what the CAD app imports.
   A public CDN file (a datasheet drawing) that fails in-page on CORS: add `serverFetch: true`.

Any other CAD site works the same way: its export endpoint in a `browser_run_script`, then
`browser_download`. A file the person already dropped into the workspace needs none of this:
`list_files` → the id.

## 2. Import into the drawing and LEARN the part before placing it

- `cad_import_<Name> { fileId, fileName, name, color, label }` — one step, the body is
  `node:<stepId>:part`. Nothing is built until `cad_build` or an open tab replays.
- READ it before touching it: `cad_describe_<Name> { nodes:["<stepId>:part"] }` answers the
  body's bbox and volume and every HOLE (radius, axis, centre, length — its angle about the
  part's axis is `atan2(centre.y, centre.x)`), BOSS and PLANE (normal, point, area), from the
  kernel. Design to those numbers, never to a screenshot: a lid's push buttons were put at 37.5°
  from a picture; the kernel said 281.5°–334°, and two windows had been cut in the wrong place.
  `cad_build` reports every body's world bbox + volume; a thin slab (`extrude` of a Ø100 circle,
  0.4 mm) measured against the part with `esoul.measure` gives an area-vs-z profile when a wall's
  thickness or an open end matters.
- The person's parts are DONE. Never cut, fuse or fillet them. Everything you design is a new
  body that attaches to them through THEIR holes and faces. If a cut into an imported part is
  ever asked for by name, prove it did something: `shape.volume` before and after — a "wire hole"
  cut into a lid that was already open at its centre removed nothing and was still reported as a
  feature.
- To LOOK at the model from outside (a film, a check): `esoul.explode { factor, parts:[{node,k}] }`
  slides the drawn bodies apart without touching the model; `esoul.camera { rotate:{dx,dy} | lookAt }`
  drives the camera one render per call.

## 3. Place by the source assembly's mates, not by eye

Onshape's occurrence `transform` is a row-major 4×4 in metres: `p' = M·p`. Two fastened parts keep
that relation; express it in the model's frame with one `transform` op per part
(`{ op:"transform", node, rotate:{ axis, angle, origin? }, translate:{x,y,z} }` — rotate first, then
translate; translations and angles take expressions). Keep physical gaps explicit (a fabric skin
between magnets: `SKIN = 1.5`) and name them in the step label.

## 4. Design the new parts as a specialist would

- Every part is its OWN body (a colour belongs to a body; a print is a body). Split a part's
  program into steps by what each IS (plate, underside, bosses, holes) so a failure names a
  thing; a label is ≤ 240 chars; inputs of several KB arrive intact; a later step cuts/fuses
  into `<earlier stepId>:<opId>`, and a body's explode transform is the LAST op of its steps.
- Print it in your head while modelling: the part prints on its flattest face; nothing bridges
  more than ~12 mm (a stand-off under a plate is a LATTICE of rings + ribs with wire corridors,
  never a plate on three islands); no support may touch a visible face (a top hat prints
  brim-down; a skirt with windows is its own ring clamped under the brim by the same screws);
  a loose part a spring or a child could push out gets a captive flange; the shrink allowance
  (0.3) goes on holes and pockets, never on outer dimensions; the print orientation and the
  screw lengths are said in the labels or the notes.
- Screws: through-holes Ø2.8 for M2.5 (Ø3.4 for M3), countersinks Ø5.5 × 1.5 on the head side,
  pilot holes Ø2.2 × 8 in bosses for self-tapping screws; bosses Ø7 on the overhang, placed at
  angles that miss everything beneath (legs, slots) — asymmetric angles make the fit keyed.
- A bought component (switch, port, module): take its dimensions from the datasheet drawing
  (download it to the workspace too), model body + pins + actuator as separate bodies where the
  colour or the motion differs, and give its pocket 0.15 mm a side.
- Anything that must stay reachable (a USB-C slot, a side button) gets a WINDOW: build the cutter
  on the +x side, `transform`-rotate it about z to the feature's angle, then `boolean cut`.
- Soft goods (a plush toy): no sharp protrusions — a feature is a sphere sunk into the host along
  the surface normal (`centre = C + (r − R + visible)·n`), a flat-based dome's rim always stands
  proud of a curved surface.
- Fits: `cad_request { kind:"query", method:"esoul.measure", args:{ nodes:[…], pairs:[[a,b],…] } }`
  → each pair's min distance and interference volume. 0 interference and the intended gap, for
  EVERY pair that touches, before you say it fits. Never check a fit with `booleanCommon` — it
  consumes the parts.

## 5. Exploded view, pictures, exports

- Variable types are chili's own words: `length` (mm), `angle` (degrees), `unitless` — any other
  word (`number`) fails EVERY build until the table is replaced.
- Explode is a VARIABLE: `cad_set_variables [{ name:"explode", type:"length", expression:"0" }]`,
  and each part's last op is `{ op:"transform", id:"explode", node, translate:{ z:"explode * k" } }`
  with k in assembly order (cup 1, lid 2, mount 3, switch 3.5, skirt 4.2, hat 4.8, band 5.4, cap 6 — at
  explode=50 every gap ≥ 6 mm). `cad_set_variables explode=50` → `cad_build` → the picture.
- `cad_build_<Name> { view:true }` builds on the server and attaches a full-size picture; a tab the
  person has open builds the same steps live. `force:true` rebuilds every step FROM SCRATCH, ignoring
  the geometry cache, and re-records it: the cache is keyed by the steps, so after a runtime fix the
  same steps build differently and the cache cannot know — force is the one way to purge it.
- A build that ends green also saves the model's GEOMETRY CACHE (one gzipped snapshot with every
  finished shape, keyed by the steps' hash): the next open of the model, in any tab or on the
  server, loads it in a second or two instead of rebuilding every step. It is stale by construction
  after a removed step, a changed variable or a hand edit, and a `cad_build` renews it — so when
  you are done with a round of steps, end with one `cad_build`; the person's next refresh is fast.
- Export each printable part by name: `cad_request { kind:"export", args:{ format:".stl", ids:["<node>"], name:"Switch mount" } }`
  (formats `.step .iges .brep .stl ".stl binary" .ply .obj`); the next `cad_build` or tab answers
  it as a workspace file named after the part (`cad_read_answer` → fileId). No `ids` = the whole
  visible model in one file.

## Honesty

Nothing exists until a build report lists the body with its bbox. A FAILED step is named with the
kernel's reason; fix the ops and build again. Say which holes you used and which gap you assumed.
A `cad_request` (query, view, export) is answered by the person's OPEN TAB first — a camera query
(`esoul.camera`) moves THEIR view and a view capture is THEIR screen; use them knowingly, and prefer
`cad_build` (the server answers every open request on its own kernel) for a close-up the person
did not ask to see. A grey disc or plane floating beside a part is a cutter's SKETCH (runtime 39
hides them; an older cache may still hold one — `cad_build { force:true }` rebuilds it); read
`cad_read_model` before blaming the geometry.

The person's open tab can hold an OLDER replay: before "fixing" a model from their screenshot,
`cad_build` and measure — a mount "without holes" was a stale tab, not a missing feature.
